 * Description:
 * The application's states and the transitions between them.
 *
 * The machine is written out here rather than left implicit in a set of
 * booleans, because the states are mutually exclusive and the bugs that arise
 * from treating them otherwise are the expensive kind: a recording that starts
 * while the permission card is up, or a countdown that keeps running after an
 * error has replaced the interface.
 *
 *   boot ──▶ guide ──▶ permission ──▶ loading ──▶ ready
 *                                                  │
 *                        review ◀── recording ◀── countdown
 *                          │                        │
 *                          └────────▶ ready ◀───────┘
 *
 *   error is reachable from every state and returns to permission on retry.
